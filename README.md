3. **Ensuring transparency**: Blockchain-based ownership records
4. **Delivering yield**: Automated rental income distributions
5. **Enabling global access**: Borderless investment opportunities

## 📈 Market Opportunity

- **Global Real Estate Market**: $280+ trillion
- **Tokenized Real Estate Projection**: $3.7 trillion by 2030
- **DeFi Total Value Locked**: $100+ billion
- **Rental Income Market**: $4.5 trillion annually

## 🔮 Future Vision

Arkly envisions a future where:
- Real estate investment is as easy as buying a token
- Property ownership is truly global and accessible
- Rental income flows seamlessly through DeFi protocols
- Traditional real estate barriers no longer exist
- Everyone can participate in the real estate economy
