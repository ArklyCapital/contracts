# Arkly Capital Security Audit Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and audit points for the Arkly Capital smart contracts. All contracts have been designed with security-first principles and follow Solana best practices.

## Security Framework

### 1. Access Control
- ✅ **Authority Verification**: All admin functions verify caller authority

### 2. Input Validation
- ✅ **Account Ownership**: All accounts verified for correct ownership
- ✅ **Parameter Bounds**: All numeric inputs validated for reasonable ranges
- ✅ **String Length Limits**: All string inputs have maximum length constraints
- ✅ **Zero Amount Checks**: Prevent zero or negative amount transactions

### 3. Arithmetic Safety
- ✅ **Overflow Protection**: All arithmetic uses checked operations
- ✅ **Precision Handling**: Proper decimal handling for token amounts
- ✅ **Rounding Logic**: Consistent rounding in favor of protocol security
- ✅ **Division by Zero**: All divisions check for zero denominators

### 4. State Management
- ✅ **Reentrancy Guards**: Critical functions protected against reentrancy
- ✅ **State Transitions**: Proper state machine implementation
- ✅ **Atomicity**: Operations are atomic where required
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Critical operations are idempotent

### 5. Token Security
- ✅ **Mint Authority**: Proper mint authority management
- ✅ **Token Account Validation**: All token accounts validated
- ✅ **Balance Checks**: Sufficient balance verification before transfers
- ✅ **Slippage Protection**: Price impact protection for large transactions

## Contract-Specific Security
